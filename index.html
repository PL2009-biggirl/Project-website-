<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<h1>I.Afraid</h1>
<p><b>I'm afraid</b> I will be forgotten<p>
<p>That I'll be trodden on.<p>
<p>Forgotten<p>

<p><b>I'm afraid</b> that everyone will realise that they don't need me.<p>
<p>Bleeding and needing I'll be a needle pinching and leeching off others.<p>
<p>Merely a parasite lacking base necessities to provide joy.<p>

<p><b>I'm afraid</b> I won't get better.<p>
<p><b>I'm afraid</b> I'll be alone with no one to help or guide me and merely be mellow and be a fellow with no love.<p>
<p><b>I'm afraid</b><p>

<h1>II.Bus</h1>
<p>I'm on a bus that is constantly treading and yelling at my laments and their intent<p>

<p>I'm on a bus that is grooving with my eulogy meanwhile, I'm merely drooling all over the back seats with no one beside me. Brainless I'm aimless with no main to pave pain away.<p>

<p>Shaking. I'm making truffle with nothing to prophesise my way.<p>

<p>I'm on a bus with no stops. No time to ponder and spend longer trying to love. I'm on a circle. I'm on nothing. That nothing has no stops.<p>
<p>Only detours<p>

<h1>III.Alone</h1>

<p>I'm alone with a phone permitting a sin so maybe I'll decide to live another day.<p>
<p>Giving the same feeling as fucking<p>
<p>but I still feel...<p>

<p>Alone.<p>

<p>I wake up wearing make-up so maybe I can take-up some euphoria and tear-off this bearing so I can find my own way, be able to progress and not devolve to loathe myself and not pose my ass for cash.<p>
<p>Alone I need to atone for my lack of love and have enough to be together. I want to be with me when I die and know who the fuck I'm looking at.<p>

<h1>IV.Parents</h1>
<p>I love one. I miss one. I'm not one. I'll never be one so my heart will always be apart with no love to hold it as a part of a mask.<p>
<p>I need a daddy. I'll never have one because like me, he too lacked love and wanted to smother my mother and brother with parasitic paralysis of love.<p>
<p>My mother would rather cover me than love me just enough to feel something. I'm afraid I'll lose her just because I can't be truthful and she runs in circles. Never stopping. Never bothering.<p>
<p>I'm apart with no parts to hold a mask.<p>

<h1>V.Euphoria</h1>
<p>Rarely I feel it but I pursue while it hides the truth.<p>
<p><b>Euphoria</b><p>
<p>Breaks me down and holds me low like Polio but I can't leave it alone because it persists and sustains in a bed of lead. My head is blown away with this lack of pain.<p>
<p><b>Euphoria</b><p>
<p>It goes straight into my veins taking the pain but leaving me on that same lane. My brain is prey to <b>Euphoria</b> but more or less I'm poorer with still being torn and mourning in the morning<p>


<h1><b>I am a numb(er)</b></h1>

<h1>I.Daylight</h1>
<p>'They' wake up. Disillusioned and purely motivated by fake tits and fake pussy. 'They' in the same red and white hoodie they've had since the beginning of days. It still fits perfectly. Their bedroom is a mess. A bunch of jumbled shit I haven't been able to let go of. The same jeans three days straight. That's a hat-trick!. The jeans clearly are far too big for them. The slight bit of their curtains get blown striking them with sporadic malice. As it blows back and forth. No windows are open...<p>
<p><b>They ignore this</b><p>
<p>They pick up a tissue from the jumbled shit and proceed to their computer. They still have their porn open from last night (or was it the day before?). They stare at the pixels of tits and pussy being dominated by a dick (I know this shit is bad). A young girl no older than eighteen screaming "fuck me daddy" with fake tits. They stare. They start unbuckling their belt and taking <b>it</b> out. It, is more flaccid than a ribeye straight from the carvery,(what the fuck is happening?). They wait. They slap it. They lube it. They try to suck it. They find it hard to breathe. Feels like my fucking lung is collapsing!? They try to perform self-fellatio. They fail. Their legs fall down. It, is still not anything. Better to just cut it off and give me a pussy! They look at their phone which looks as ancient as Tutankhamun, still having a button. The time is 2:45 PM. They go to their camera roll and find a picture. Someone roughly the same age as them. It's a picture of the both of them smiling. They, is still trying to awaken, it. They start again with more ferocity. They, are trying to picture the someone naked. After 2 minutes they finish. Not even zipping up they go back to bed. They lie down watching the same porn on their phone as they slowly drift off.<p>

<h1>II.Audio</h1>
<p>They are sitting down in their kitchen, living room hybrid. They sit staring at the blank white walls. Silence. The void of the kitchen pleased them. A departure of the grunting and fake moaning that flooded their ear canals drowning out any humanity. Just sex. They felt contempt. Just for a second.<p>

<p>Then.BAM. The loud and ear-piercing vibration and bass of their ringtone. Their ringtone was some whack and bullshit trap,rap song with lyrics like "then that bitch opened up that pussy and let me have a bite and I let her have a taste as I was cumming on her face, tits, ass and pussy". "Bitch" was calling (this was just my mum) and they answered slowly. My mum was complaining about my cummy pants she had to deal with (it's my fucking body!). They, responded with "then maybe you shouldn't have been getting tag-teamed on my eighth birthday!". She hung up. They continue to stare. Staring like a voyeur at their step-aunt (lol!) and that bush.<p>

<p>They stand up and travel to the fridge as if saving the nation. I can hardly stay awake (what am I doing?). They look at the fridge. Lacking everything but a six-pack of heinecken. They take out all six. Viscously opens all at the same time.<p>

<p>Now they're on the bus. It's rancid with used condoms and the sound of moans bombarding their ear. It's dark oustide. There's nothing inside or outside the bus. The engine stops. It's quiet (who am I?).<p>
<p>What am I doing?<p>
<p>What's my purpose<p>
<p>Who am?<p>
<p>Who am I?<p>
<p>Who?<p>
<p>W o  a m?<p>
<p>m I a?<p>

<h1>III.Broken</h1>
<p>Who are you?<p>
<p>Why bother?<p>
<p>I need help<p>
<p>I'm drifting off<p>
<p>I'm falling<p>
<p>I'm calling you<p>
<p>Shut the fuck up<p>
<p><p>
<p>Just die<p>
<p>You serve no purpose<p>
<p>Just be quiet<p>
<p>It's all okay<p>

<h1>IV.Recovery</h1>
<p>Oh hold me closer.<p>
<p>I need you.<p>
<p>I love you.<p>
<p>There's only one you.<p>
<p>You matter.<p>
<p>They gulp. They love. They take the tablet.<p>
<p>Serene<p>
<p>They talk. They walk. They feel.<p>
<p>I need you<p>
<p>There's no one like you<p>

<h1>V.Reality</h1>
<p>They felt themselves. To ease the nerves. They were going to do it.<p>
<p>Feel love.<p>
<p>They breathed. They got off their seat and were ready to approach. The only person they feel like they got them. She's sat down and stern. Looking ahead. "Your stop's coming" she stated retaining eye contact with them throughout.<p>
<p>The engine and the bus started to slow down. It stopped. "You need to get off". "It's time". They started walking.<p>
<p>What do you feel?<p>
<p>Who are you?<p>
<p>I'm alone. I'm nobody.<p>
<p>You need to grow up.<p>
<p>You need to look at yourself<p>
<p>You are pathetic<p>
<p>They wake up. Everything is blinding. No one is there. They're off the stop and it's time for life<p>

<h1>VI.Life</h1>
<p>They woke up. They is sitting on a chair in the middle of a room. It's a void. Completely empty of human emotion.<p>
<p>They walked outside. The sun smothered their face, blinding them with enough clarity to allow you to see Jesus.<p>
<p>Everything is broken and they're feeling token when walloping their feet to the mall. They, walk like there's no tomorrow. Fast, sporadic like an asthmatic fasting.<p>
<p>So many beautiful people.<p>
<p>So much life.<p>
<p>They, walk to the nearest Primark. Clothes laid out like medication.<p>
<p>"... what're you doing here?" said the manager.<p>
<p>"Observing" they, said with a hunched posture and dead eyes.<p>
<p>Dead eyes<p>
<p>The manager's face was pretty. I felt like proposing that would only be reacted to in disdain. My brain flashes and lashes my irises with images of menageries and it's just us two around. No thought of fu-.<p>
<p>No thought of sex<p>
<p>Only happiness<p>
<p>"I need you". They stated, startling the manager.<p>
<p>"Why?" responded the manager conceringly.<p>
<p>"Because I don't want to die alone! They screeched whilst, holding back tears of emptiness.<p>
<p>"Oh"<p>
<p>"Oh! I need you, I want you. There's no one like you. You need to help me grow up! I'm alone all the time. Everday and all night I lay awake hoping for someone like you. I'm good now! Don't leave me! I need a daddy and want you to fuck me! Please I need you! I'll die without you. I fucking will! I'll slice my wrists because of you! HA HA HA HAAH. It was a joke. Now please! I don't want to die!"<p>

<h1>VII.Why?/I've failed</h1>
<p>Why walk away?<p>
<p>Why try?<p>
<p>Why bother?<p>
<p>Why wake up?<p>
<p>Why should I get better?<p>
<p>Why be around another day?<p>
<p>I've failed everything<p>
<p>Why have I?<p>
<p>I'm a failure<p>
<p>I'm nothing<p>
<p>Why?<p>
<p>I've failed my mum<p>
<p>I've failed me<p>
<p>Why try? I've failed<p>
<p>I've failed life<p>
<p>Why live on?<p>
<p>Why am I on this Earth?<p>
<p>I serve no purpose<p>
<p>Who will miss me?<p>
<p>No one even knows me<p>
<p>I don't even know me anymore<p>
<p>I'm still that kid. I'll never change.<p>
<p>So why bother?<p>
